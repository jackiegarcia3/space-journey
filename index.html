    <p> Hello, I am Jackelin Garcia and I am a Senior in High School. I am very excited but nervous to be graduating this year. I enjoy baking, reading and taking pictures of nature. I am a fan of South Korean music and also a Japanese band called One Ok Rock. I enjoy watching Korean movies and Taiwanese dramas.

    <p>I recently ventured out and watched a Malaysian tv show and loved it. My favorite movies are My Neighbor Totoro, Whisper of the Heart and Howl's Moving Castle. I went to go see Jumanji on New Years with my family. I have most recently seen The Foreigner and absolutely loved it, Jackie Chan was great! I also went to go see The Greatest Showman and loved how even though no one had faith that P.T. Barnum would make it possible, he showed them and made it possible.<p>
